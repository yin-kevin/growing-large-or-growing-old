---------------
Adjustments:
---------------

1. Artificially balanced the deciles in "standardize_panel_empl.do"

Having one employee put your firm in deciles 1, 2, and 3 at the same time so these were randomly divided up.
Decile 4 was firms up to and INCLUDING 2 employees whereas Decile 5 was greater than 2 but less than 2.25. 

2. Changed the number of autocorrelations considered to 14 from 21 in "PSS_replication_empl.do"

No firm survives more than 14 years in the employment data.

3. Employment levels are decimals for some reason. Classes are defined [x,y).
